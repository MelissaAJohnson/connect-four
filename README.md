# Connect Four
This is a simple JavaScript implementation of the classic Connect Four game completed as part of a Bloc project. I don't have it hosted so you need to download the repo and load the files in your browser locally.

**Note**
- Much of the code found on [JavaScriptSource](http://www.javascriptsource.com/games/connect-4.html) was leveraged for this project
- I also referred to Adam Khoury's YouTube series on [custom confirmation dialogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCL90kPID0A)

My contribution to the code consisted mostly of:
- stylizing
- cleaning up code (e.g. separating style code into a css files, and scripts into a .js file)
- improved usability
- elminating extraneous code
